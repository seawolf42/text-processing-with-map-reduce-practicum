=========================================

Implementations of algorithms from the paper "Data-Intensive Text Processing with MapReduce"

Developers reading the paper "Data-Intensive Text Processing with MapReduce" by Lin and Dyer (2010) are presented with several algorithms in pseudo-code for implementing several common MapReduce patterns for text processing and mathematical analysis. This repository is intended to provide actual working implementations of these algorithms.
