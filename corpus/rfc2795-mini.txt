This memo describes a protocol suite which supports an infinite
number of monkeys that sit at an infinite number of typewriters in
order to determine when they have either produced the entire works of
William Shakespeare or a good television show.  The suite includes
communications and control protocols for monkeys and the
organizations that interact with them.
